# Hi there! I'm Jun-Hee Hwang üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I graduated from the University of California, San Diego with a Data Science major. I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems, with a focus on machine learning, data science, and software development. My work spans diverse domains, including neutrino physics, greenhouse gas emissions modeling, and predictive analytics.

## üî≠ Projects

- **Majorana Neutrino Hunt** ([Website](https://junismyname.github.io/MajoranaNeutrinoHunt-Website/)): Applied machine learning to Particle Physics. Studied time-series waveform data from the Majorana Demonstrator, extracting features and building models to identify neutrinoless double beta decay events and study matter-antimatter asymmetry.
  - Processed over 2 million data entries, optimizing Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost models with RandomizedSearchCV and SMOTE, achieving up to 0.9940 accuracy and 0.9671 F1-Score.
  - Enhanced model interpretability through SHAP values and feature importance analyses for robust event prediction. 
  
- **Speech Emotion Recognition** ([Showcase](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g6Z6KEemH3BcP1AUWjN5yAszw8Bv_3aC/view)): Built a classifier that categorizes human emotion in audio signals under the mentorship of Professor Justin Eldridge.
  - Created and compared several models including CNN, Vision Transformation, Ensemble CNN, and SVM.
  - Achieved 0.76 accuracy and 0.78 precision in the top-performing model.
    
- **Remote CO‚ÇÇ Consumption** ([GitHub](https://github.com/Junismyname/Remote-CO2-Emissions189)): Conducted an in-depth analysis on the environmental impact of remote work by examining CO‚ÇÇ emissions across U.S. states from 2018 to 2021, integrating datasets from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the Census Bureau.     
  - Findings demonstrated statistically significant emission reductions, supporting remote work policies as an effective sustainability measure.
  - Analyzed 50+ state datasets over 4 years, processed 10,000+ entries to assess remote work‚Äôs impact on CO‚ÇÇ emissions, built a logistic regression model with 80.5% accuracy, and identified statistically significant emission reductions during 2020.
 
- **Power Outage Causes** ([GitHub](https://gabrielchasukjin.github.io/Power-Outage-Classification-Model/)): Built a Decision Tree model using Scikit-Learn to classify the cause of severe power outages, which could aid energy companies in developing preventive measures and response plans, enhancing grid resilience.
   - Achieved an accuracy score of 0.827 and applied GridSearchCV to find the optimal hyperparameters and improved model accuracy by 3.92% on the validation dataset resulting in a total accuracy of 0.8.

## üí° Skills

- **Programming Languages**: Python, R, MATLAB
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Data Analysis**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Beautiful Soup, Pyspark, Dask, ArcGis

## üåü Experiences
- **Keywords Studios (Research Associate)**:
  - Collaborated with a team of Data Specialists to fine-tune AI training prompts, enhancing model consistency and data accuracy in support of generative AI projects.
  - Executed data collection and annotation tasks, providing quantitative and qualitative feedback to improve AI model performance and identifying areas for process optimization.

- **GBCS Group (GHG Researcher Intern)**: 
  - Developed an AI model to predict CO‚ÇÇ emissions across transportation lifecycle stages.
  - Performed in-depth research on CO‚ÇÇ emissions across roughly 50 diverse fleets in air, ground, and sea transport, examining emissions data across each lifecycle stage‚Äîyielding precise insights to inform sustainable fleet management practices.
  
- **Teaching & Learning Commons, University of California, San Diego (Experiential Learning Ambassador)**:
  - Created quarterly data visualizations about the university‚Äôs programs/positions and departments with the most/least opportunities using Excel, Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
  - Identified approximately 15,000 missing data entries from the university‚Äôs official data hub, representing around 7.92% of the dataset, significantly enhancing data accuracy and operational efficiency.
